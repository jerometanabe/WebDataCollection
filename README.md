# WebDataCollection
Python script for collecting information on all products from the webpage of an online store

Hello!

This script is written in python and used for collecting information from a bookstore website: https://books.toscrape.com/index.html
The website allows its users to freely scrape the information on the site for educational purposes.

The goal of the project is to automate the collection of product information for data analysis.

The script can be broken down into three main parts:

- A way to automatically move through pages (There are 50 individual pages containing products)
- Collecting individual product URLs that are posted on each page (20 products per page)
- Collecting the important information from each product URL

The future goals of this project will be to create a dashboard that displays product information and another data collection script that interacts with Wikipedia's API to collect more information on the books in the storefront.

This is the first project posted by myself. Hopefully one of many.

Special thanks to Lilo Tanabe (image below for reference) for keeping me company while I worked on this project and Kyle A. for providing a code review to critique the first version of my script.
